
1. download imagem regiao

2. combine bands (indice, 4, 8) from image + mask (qgis) (build virtual raster -- place each input file into a separate band)

3. recortar

4. raster mask num ficheiro diferente (rasterize 10m)

CRS!! 3763

juntar (B2, Nvdi + indice) + mask
recortar
retirar a mask (um da mask e outro do resto)

Workflow?
Data preparation - podemos usar augmentation techniques para aumentar a variabilidade do dataset
Model selection - escolher uma CNN architecture. maybe U-Net?
Model training - the CNN model is trained on the dataset using a segmentation loss function such as the dice coefficient or cross-entropy loss. the model is initialized with pre-trained weights, and the final layers are fine-tuned for the task. the training process involves iterative optimization of the model parameters using gradient descent
Hyperparameter tuning - learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance. This involves running experiments with different hyperparameters settings and evaluating the model performance on a validation set
Model evaluation - the trained model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance. This involves computing standard performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The segmentation results can also be visually inspected and compared with ground truth annotation to assess the accuracy and generalization of the model.
Deployment - once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for use on new satellite images - HuggingFaces
